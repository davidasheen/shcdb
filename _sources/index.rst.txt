Welcome to the home page for the Small Hydrocarbons Combustion Properties Database. This is a database of laminar flame speeds and ignition delay times for a range of small hydrocarbon fuels, along with a model for simulating these experiments. The model is based on `JetSurF 2.0 <https://web.stanford.edu/group/haiwanglab/JetSurF/JetSurF2.0/howtocite.html>`_, with the hydrogen oxidation submodel reset to its nominal values. See `Sheen & Wang <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2010.12.016>`_ for more details on the base JetSurF model.
